## Calculator

ðŸŽ¬ [See it in action](https://heynicortiz.github.io/top_calculator/) ðŸŽ¬

This is a basic calculator page that allows a user to complete the following functions:
- add
- subtact
- multiply
- divide

The calculator completes one operation at a time and requires a new value to be entered before completing more calculations.

This is the basic draft, more styling and functionality checks to follow.

## The Odin Project
I completed this as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) as I work to learn JavaScript and improve on my prior web experience with HTML, CSS, and only borrowed scripts!
